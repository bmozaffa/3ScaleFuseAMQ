# Spring-Boot Camel QuickStart

This demo demonstrates how to use SQL via JDBC along with Camel's REST DSL to expose a RESTful API.

This example relies on the Fabric8 Maven plugin for its build configuration and uses the FIS Java base image



Background


This is a microservice that connects to a table in MySQL database, that provide 3 different functionality through APIs

Balance By providing the account id, it will retreive the remaining balance from the table and returns the result as Text.
Profile By providing the account id,
Transfer By providing the sender id, receiver id and also the amount to transfer, it will update the balance of both the sender and receiver on the remaining balance respectively. Transaction is needed this time, in case if there are any problem when updating the tables.

### Building

The example can be built with

    mvn clean install

### Running the example in OpenShift

It is assumed that:
- OpenShift platform is already running, if not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/install_config/index.html).
- Your system is configured for Fabric8 Maven Workflow, if not you can find a [Get Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-middleware-for-openshift/3/single/red-hat-jboss-fuse-integration-services-20-for-openshift/)

The example can be built and run on OpenShift using a single goal:

    mvn fabric8:deploy

When the example runs in OpenShift, you can use the OpenShift client tool to inspect the status

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the OpenShift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/getting_started/developers_console.html#developers-console-video) to manage the
running pods, and view logs and much more.

### Running via an S2I Application Template

Application templates allow you deploy applications to OpenShift by filling out a form in the OpenShift console that allows you to adjust deployment parameters.  This template uses an S2I source build so that it handle building and deploying the application for you.

First, import the Fuse image streams:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/GA/fis-image-streams.json

Then create the quickstart template:

    oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-fuse/application-templates/GA/quickstarts/spring-boot-camel-template.json

Now when you use "Add to Project" button in the OpenShift console, you should see a template for this quickstart.
