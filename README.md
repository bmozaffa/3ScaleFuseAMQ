# IntegrationApp Automation


## Demo Story

An integration application consisting of Multiple services working in combination (let's say single front end with dispatch to two back-ends), one or more APIs that need to be managed via 3scale, and one or more messaging destinations/addresses used for event-driven inputs and outputs. Now want to automate deployment of this application across multiple environments, using pre-defined pipelines provided by the platform. The delivery pipelines must support environment-specific properties, testing, versioning, and the ability to rollback incomplete or failed deployments.

 Steps
 
     • Design an application that integrates with Fuse, AMQ, and 3Scale.
     • Source to Image (S2I) build and deploy apps on openshift environment.
     • Building a pipeline to support automated CI/CD
     • Expose a REST API using Camel, and export API doc to swagger
     • Publish API on 3scale environment using CI/CD pipeline .
     • Manage the API through 3scale API management and update the application plan to rate-limit the application.
     • Design a web application that invokes the 3scale API gateway .

### Jenkins Deplyoment  Applications in OpenShift.

TODO: -The below deployment will be achieved using Jenkins Pipelines CICD approach.

     • Deploying application to DEV Environment.
     • Deploying application from development to UAT Environment. 	 	
     • Deploying application in Production Environment.
     • Deploying application to Production DR Environment.
     • Publishing API’s in  3scale : (By using Operator or ansible playbooks).
