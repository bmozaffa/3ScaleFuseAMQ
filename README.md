# 3ScaleFuseAMQ


## Demo Story

I'm a developer that's created an integration application consisting of
Multiple services working in combination (let's say single front end with dispatch to two back-ends)
One or more APIs that need to be managed via 3scale
One or more messaging destinations/addresses used for event-driven inputs and outputs
I now want to automate deployment of this application across multiple environments using pre-defined pipelines provided by the platform.  The delivery pipelines must support environment-specific properties, testing, versioning, and the ability to rollback incomplete or failed deployments.

 Steps

* Design a application which integrated with Fuse , AMQ , 3Scale .
* Source to Image (S2i) build and deploy apps on openshift enviroment. 
* Building a pipeline to support automated CI/CD
* Exposing a REST API using Camel, and export API doc to swagger
* Pubslish API on 3scale enviroment using CI/CD pipeline .
* Manage the API through 3scale API management and update the application plan to rate-limit the application.
* Design a web application which invokes the 3scale API gateway .

### Setting up Environemnt in OpenShift


CI/CD  integration using Jenkins Pipline Approach

TODO: 
-The below deployment will be achieved using Jenkins Piplines  using CICD approach . 

-Setting up DEV Environemnt .

-Setting up UAT Environemnt .

-Deploying up web application .

-Setting Up Production Environment .

-Setting up 3scale API Management: (By using Operator or ansible playbooks)
